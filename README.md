# Mango Leaf Disease Classification
# Introduction
This project aims to classify mango leaf diseases using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and compare their performance with traditional machine learning algorithms. Our goal is to improve disease identification and management in mango crops, which can ultimately lead to increased crop yields.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains images of healthy and diseased mango leaves, with a total of eight different classes. The dataset can be found

# Dataset Details
* Train: 3200 images belonging to 8 classes
* Test: 800 images belonging to 8 classes
# Data Exploration
Images per class distribution
Average image dimensions: Width: 274.92, Height: 260.27
